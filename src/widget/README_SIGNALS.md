# Pushrod Widget Signals

Signals are a way for messages to be sent to widgest when an action takes place.  Signals indicate an interaction
of some sort has occurred, and the widget should respond to the signal.  (This is similar to Qt's Signals/Slots,
but requires very little work to get implemented.)
