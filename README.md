# rust-pinrod

GEM-like Widget Library for Rust Piston library.

Incorporates Atari GEM/VDI ideas with callbacks and Objects (Widgets), which
are ideas of other GUI libraries - Qt, Atari, Amiga, Tk, and others.  It draws
inspiration from other libraries, letting you concentrate on code rather than
obsessing over the interface.
